		/*
		 * we can have multiple objects.Eg. inside one class we can created horse, dog and another object inside class
		 * User defined classes are created by java already or we create the class. ex; I created a class for dog
		 * 
		 * Method:is piece of function that takes from the keyboard. Most of the thing in Java is a class
		 * then divided to attribute and behavior 
		 * 1- Attribute:
		 * 2- Behavior:
		 * A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
		 * 
		 * Object Oriented Program is a set of rules, methods, techniques, to build a software.
		 * it helps easily add features to the software
		 * it helps to build the software
		 * 
		 * OOP also simplifies the software usage, makes the code clean and useful for the future
		 * maintenance in software means adding new features, improvements to add in the software, upgrading
		 * adding new feature to an already existence software
		 * need a platform to add, debug, improve, save coding is part of the OOP
		 * 
		 * OOP is faster and easier to execute
		 * OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
		 * OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
		 * OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
		 * 
		 * A class in Java can contain 
		 * 1- variable/field/ properties --->
		 * 2- method/functions ---->
		 * instantiate is the another name for for declaring or creating a object---> 
		 * instances---> it is a different name for the object, attributes and behavior 
		 * 
		 * Attribute: includes types or characteristics or features or 
		 * Behavior: the actions, the way to perform or customer expectation from the performance of the class
		 * Object: is a basic unit of object oriented programming and represent the real life entities
		 * an object consists of 
		 * State: it presents the attribute 
		 * Behavior:presented by methods and also response 
		 * Identity:it gives a unique name to an object
		 * 
		 * Consider there is a Class ---> Fields/properties/ ---> Methods/behavior/function
		 * 
		 * Method is the most important thing is """Creating a class and Identify the Method----> Method is the most
		 * important 
		 * Statement in java is ending with semicolon ";"
		 * I can put multiple statement inside the method 
		 * " void" starts the method" Example: 
		 * I create a method when I need something repeatidly or again and again I need it I create a method
		 * 
		 * for now creating a method we Use VOID ---> method describes the behavior of an object
		 * method contains block of codes 
		 * it is subprogram 
		 * Java method created inside java class.
